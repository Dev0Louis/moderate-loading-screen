An "alternative" to Mod Menu that's a lot less usable. (full feature parity not included) 

Makes the icons of installed mods fall down the loading screen like snowflakes.
Includes a few configuration options like showing every mod only once, 
and changing the background color. 
I'd recommend installing the Mod Menu mod to access the configs.

Tested with 1.17-1.18.1.
